# EC2-Instance-WITH-LB
This is a terraform learning repository, were we will define a vpc with public access and create it with a LOAD BALANCER

HEllo Welcome to New Chapter called EC2-instacne with Load-balancer.

# Here we will be creating a ec2-instance with LOAD Balancer.

# We will be using the AWS with terraform to create the instance and the load balancer.


# Here we have created two files
1. provider-variable.tf
2. provider.tfvars

# The Difference btw them are
# provider-variable.tf is used to define the provider
# provider.tfvars is used to define the variable for the provider. Example if you need to define the value then you need to use this argunmet like "-var-file"
